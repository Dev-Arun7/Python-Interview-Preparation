Python for Coding Interviews
Introduction

This repository contains Python code snippets that cover fundamental concepts commonly encountered in coding interviews. Whether you're preparing for technical interviews or simply looking to reinforce your Python skills, these snippets provide a concise reference.
Contents

The repository covers the following topics:

    Variables: Dynamic typing, multiple assignments, incrementing, and the use of None.
    If-statements: Conditional branching without parentheses or curly braces, and multi-line conditions.
    Loops: while loops, for loops, and loop variations (e.g., looping backward, using ranges).
    Math: Basic mathematical operations, division behavior, rounding, and mathematical helpers.
    Arrays (Lists): Creation, manipulation, indexing, slicing, list comprehension, and multidimensional lists.
    Strings: String operations, immutability, numeric/string conversions, and ASCII values.
    Queues (Deque): Creation, appending, popping, and left operations.
    HashSets: Creation, addition, removal, existence check, conversions, and set comprehension.
    HashMaps (Dict): Creation, modification, retrieval, existence check, and dict comprehension.
    Tuples: Creation, indexing, immutability, usage as keys in maps/sets.
    Heaps: Creation, pushing, popping, heapify, and max heap workaround.
    Functions: Declaration, nested functions, modifying objects, and accessing outer variables.
    Classes: Declaration, constructor, member functions, and object instantiation.

Usage

Each code snippet is self-contained and can be run independently. You can copy the relevant snippets into your Python environment or IDE to experiment with them further.
